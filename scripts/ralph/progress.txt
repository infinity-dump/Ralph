# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2024-01-15

## Codebase Patterns
- Ralph: Normalize story selection with jq (priority/status/dependencies) and fall back gracefully when jq is missing
- Migrations: IF NOT EXISTS
- Types: Export from actions.ts

## Key Files
- db/schema.ts
- app/auth/actions.ts

## 2026-01-11 - US-001
- Implemented priority/status/dependency-aware story selection in `ralph.sh` and injected the selected story into the prompt.
- Updated `prd.json` stories to use numeric priority, dependencies arrays, and status fields.
- **Learnings:**
  - Normalize legacy priority strings to numeric values for backward compatibility.
  - Guard jq usage so the loop still runs when jq is unavailable.
